# Shoe Inventory DB Website
A website created with Visual Basic, SQL, and PowerBI that streamlines a tool for a business owner to keep track of their inventory (Shoes).
Within this website the user is able to add, edit, or delete a row of data into the website's database. This is to serve a hypothetical business owner (Fransico) so they are able to track the inventory they are brining in. 
Furthermore, it gives the description of the shoe, the price point the shoe was bought for, shoe name, shoe brand, shoe type, shoe condition, size, release date, and acquired date of the shoe. This is to help Fransico keep
track of his inventory and to solve the problem of mentally or utilizing an outdated way of keeping up to date with his inventory.
